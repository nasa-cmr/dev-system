# cmr-dev-system

Dev System combines together the separate microservices of the CMR into a single application to make it simpler to develop.

## Setting up for local development.

You can setup locally for running the CMR in memory by doing the following. You'll need a URS username that's been granted access to the repository. After this has completed you can start a REPL in dev-system.

1. git clone ***REMOVED***
2. cd cmr
3. dev-system/support/setup_local_dev.sh

## Security of dev system

Dev system is meant to be used for testing only. It provides a control API that allows unrestricted access to shutdown the system, evaluate arbitrary code, remove all data, etc.
